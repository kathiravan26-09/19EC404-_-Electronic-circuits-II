## **Result**
Thus, the **voltage series feedback amplifier** is designed and constructed.  
The following parameters are calculated:

| S.No | Parameters | Without Feedback | With Feedback |
|:----:|-------------|:----------------:|:--------------:|
| 1 | Lower cut-off frequency | =200 Hz| =100 Hz |
| 2 | Upper cut-off frequency | = 8 KHz | =12 KHz |
| 3 | Bandwidth | \( BW = fh - fl = 78KHz \) | \( BW = f'h - f'l =12.9 KHz \) |
| 4 | Mid-band Gain | \( A{v(mid)} = 16.70 \) | \( A'{v(mid)} = 14.52 \) |
| 5 | Gain at half power point | 10 | 7.8 |
---
**Conclusion:**  
The frequency response of the voltage-series feedback amplifier was studied. It was observed that the **gain decreases** while the **bandwidth increases** when negative feedback is applied, confirming the theoretical expectations.
